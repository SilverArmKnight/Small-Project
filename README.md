# Small-Project: Multiclipboard

Imagine filling many forms with the same information for a long period of time. This task is repetitive and inefficient. The Multiclipboard helps speedup the process by saving
the information with the keyword, and load the information into the clipboard with that same keyword when you need them.

You also need to put the file directory into the path. Press Windows + R and use the commands in the program to save the information.
